Hello there, thanks for checking out this blog. I'm aiming to make this blog useful for other developers that are interested in learning how to apply agile practices to their databases, and help skill up on new ways to work with data within the Microsoft and Apache stacks. I've worked with various databases for 10+ years across different business areas, so hopefully there's going to be something on this site that can help you out.

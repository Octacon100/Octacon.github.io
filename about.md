I'm an Australian that has been living in Massachusetts for 10+ years, and have worked with databases and reporting for most of that time. I've worked with Oracle, Microsoft Sql Server, Hyperion and plenty of other databases and reporting software. I'm hoping this blog will help others with agile database practices, database CI/CD and various other data tips and tricks I can help out with.
